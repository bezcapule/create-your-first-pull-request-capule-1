My expectations about my journey in CMSC 100 is that I will be having a hard time since everything is new to me in this course. I am also not used to asking questions even though I am having a hard time. I hope that I will overcome all my problems in CMSC 100 with the help of my professor and classmates.

Barral: I Agree with your expectation. I also expect it to be hard and I just hope to pass this course.
